This is example code of a Ruby/Rails app which utilizes the databasedot.com API to update a SalesForce db when a user gets created
and when a user signs-in. The key things to focus on is the code in the controller (visitors.rb) and databasedotcom.yml file. If you have
any questions, please email me at daniele.hohol@gmail.com and i'd be happy to help!
